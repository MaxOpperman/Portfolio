# Portfolio / Resume Website

This is a personal portfolio website created using React (JS) and Webpack.
The website serves as a static webpage showcasing my work, skills, and professional experience.
It is designed to provide a clean, modern interface for potential clients or employers to explore my projects and learn more about my background.

## Running the Project

### For Development Mode:
For development mode:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start a local development server at [http://localhost:3000], where you can view and interact with your website.
Any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh the page, providing a smooth and efficient development experience.

### For Production Mode:
Once you're ready to deploy your website or generate a production-ready version, use the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized, minified version of the website in the `build/` folder.
The production build is optimized for performance, ensuring your website loads quickly and efficiently when deployed to a live server.
